## ℹ Description

<p>Not every app needs to be groundbreaking — sometimes, the emphasis is on the problem, not the product.</p>

<p>I recently built a small app – <strong>Qaza Salat</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not designed for the masses — it’s just relevant to a few, and that’s alright. The real emphasis here was on solving a specific, meaningful problem.</p>

<p>I asked myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>➡️ How can someone log missed prayers (Qaza) with minimal friction?</li>
  <li>➡️ Could it work without even opening the app?</li>
  <li>➡️ How do you keep personal data safe and backed up across devices?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions led to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>📱 A Home Screen Widget for instant updates</li>
  <li>🎯 Custom Goal Setting</li>
  <li>🔐 Auth-Protected Profiles</li>
  <li>☁️ Cloud Syncing with Firebase</li>
</ul>
<br>

## ✨ Features
